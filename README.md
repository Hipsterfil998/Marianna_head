## The Story Behind the Name

Our virtual guide takes her name from a fascinating piece of Neapolitan history known as "Donna Marianna 'a cap'e Napule" (Donna Marianna, the head of Naples). In the 17th century, a large marble head of a woman was discovered in the Piazza Mercato area. This remarkable find was documented in Carlo Celano's 1692 work "Notizie del bello, dell'antico e del curioso della citt√† di Napoli" (News of the beautiful, the ancient, and the curious of the city of Naples), where it was identified as the head of the mythical Siren Parthenope.

The people of Naples affectionately named this artifact "'a cap'e Napule," and it became a beloved symbol of the city's rich historical and mythological heritage. Today, this impressive marble head is preserved in Palazzo San Giacomo, Naples' City Hall, where it continues to inspire and connect present-day Naples with its ancient past.
